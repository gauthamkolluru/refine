# Next Steps

- Config and settings UI (threshold, max comments, backend URL).
- Deploy backend to a hosted environment (add auth/rate limiting).
- Improve error handling UX for backend failures or limits.
- Normalize comment text (emojis, links, line breaks) before analysis.
- Performance polish for large threads (debounce observer bursts, avoid re-processing).
- Optional: batch analysis to reduce API costs.
